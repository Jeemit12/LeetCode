/*
There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either 1 or 2.

The cost of a path between any two nodes u and v is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

Select any one node x at the maximum depth. Return the number of ways to assign edge weights in the path from node 1 to x such that its total cost is odd.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
